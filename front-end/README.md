Notations
=========

I've wrapped some text like this:

```
``` some text ```
```
That means either an icon is needed there or the text is badly formatted or the link is broken.

*Do you have any other way to highlight broken links??* Do we need to name our html files with the `.html` suffix? There's no problem with links on my machine when I tested it.

You can keep that `nav-bar` smart-visible right?

There are some links which are valid but cannot be accesed now. For example those that lead to the Game Spec, leaderboard etc. Do we have to add those links later or is there a way to catch the, redirect them to a popup or a page? Such links I have tried to mark with

```
$%$ some text $%$
```

We have to find out how to render latex on our pages. See [specs.html](specs.html)

Others
------

The `RULES EXPLORE SCHEDULE` icons need a change, I'm sure you have a lot at your disposal.
Can that `LEARN MORE` text be modified?

I need those arrow icons in the carousel: `REGISTER ... SHARE`.

News cannot be a carousel. Is there anything else in the theme? Lets use this image for backdrop. I don't know how to add it!

Update all `Contact Us` links to the footer that already exists.

New Pages
=========

Can you upload a dummy template html page? Where can I see the available theme items online, myself?
I tried linking the `Contact Us` with `href="#contact-info"`. Didn't work. I don't know how its done anyways. Please tell.
